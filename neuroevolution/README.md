# Neuroevolution


Neuroevolution is an exciting field within artificial intelligence that leverages evolutionary algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks. Unlike traditional deep learning approaches that rely on gradient-based optimization, neuroevolution allows the design and fine-tuning of both the **architecture** and the **parameters** of neural networks by simulating evolutionary processes like **mutation**, **crossover**, and **natural selection**.

This tutorial will provide you with helpful resources, including slides, interactive notebooks, and video explanations, to dive into the world of neuroevolution. By the end of this course, you will understand how evolutionary methods can be applied to neural networks and gain hands-on experience with the provided tools.
